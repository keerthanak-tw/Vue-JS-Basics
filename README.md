## Vue JS Tutorial

The project contains small demo that helps to understand basic elements of Vue JS.
The content is taken from the [official website](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/). The explanations can also be found on the 
same website. 

The purpose of this project is just to cumulate all the data and resources so that it would be easier to keep track.

The basics section covers:<br>
1. [Hello Vue](./hello-world/)
2. [Declarative rendering](./declarative-rendering/)
3. [Conditional rendering](./conditional-rendering/)
4. [Looping](./loops/)
5. [Event handling](./user-input/)
6. [Components](./components/)

### Vue CLI for application development
We can install Vue CLI using npm. Run the following command to install Vue on local machine.
```shell
npm install -g @vue/cli
```
Once this is done, you could get a boilerplate code by running the following command.
```shell
vue create <app-name>
```
The app created in this way can be found at [application  1](./quiz/) (Tutorial can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4deVCNJq3qc)).
The [bootstrap library](https://bootstrap-vue.org/), where we can get the form elements, layouts etc., is used to develop the components.<br>
Check out [application 2](./adopt-pets/) to find out how routers and vuex (state management) is used in Vue JS.
